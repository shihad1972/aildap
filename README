These are various ldap utilities when you have an ldap directory used for
user authentication

lcc
  This will generate the ldif to either add or remove the main containers
or ou's, for your directory. You have the option of adding a sudoers ou
as well
-i	insert
-r	remove
-d	domain name
-s	sudo

lcc [ -i | -r ] -d <domain-name> (-s)

lsc
  This will generate an ssl configuration to add to the already existing
configuration for the domain. You must have already have the certificate
and key pair for the domain, and optionally the CA certificate. The key
should be in /etc/ldap/ssl.key, the certificate in /etc/ldap/ssl.crt and
the CA cert (if you wish to add it) in /etc/ssl/certs. The CA certificate
file postfix should be .pem, as should the domain key file. The domain
certificate file should be postfixed with .crt. The domain key and certificate
should have their name as the domain name.

-i	insert
-r	remove
-a	CA certificate
-d	domain

lsc [ -i | -r ] -d <domain-name> (-a CA-file-name)

ltc
  This will test a connection to the ldap database and will search for the
user you specify on the command line.

-d	base domain in the directory
-u	user you want to search for
-h	host name of the ldap server

ltc -d <domain-name> -u user -h host

ssha
  Test program to output sha1 and ssha1 hashes of password

ssha

lgc
  This will create an ldif for a new group to insert into the LDAP directory.
You can also specify users on the command line that will part of this group.

-d	base domain in the directory
-g	gid of the group
-n	name of the group
-u	comma separated list of users to be part of the group

lgc -d domain-name -g gid -n group [ -u user1,user2,...,userN ]

lcu
  This will create an ldif for a new user in the LDAP directory. Using the options
you can create a dedicated group for the user and also have a choice of username
styles (first-name or first initial and surname). You can also choose to have no
password associated with the user.

-d	base domain in the directory
-n	full name of the user
-u	userid
-g	create group
-l	use long version of username (first initial and surname)
-p	do not prompt for password

lcu -d domain [ -g ] [ -l ] [ -p ] -n full-name -u userid

lrc
  This will create an ldif configuration for replication a directory from
another server. This will create 2 ldif configuration files; one for the
provider (or source) and one for the consumer (or destination). You will have
to know the database number of the specific part of the directory you wish to
replicate.

-h host
-d domain
-u user
-b database number
-t | -s Start Tls or use Ssl encryption.
-c certificate path (Can add this or we will add tls_reqcert=never)
