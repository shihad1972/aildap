These are various ldap utilities when you have an ldap directory used for
user authentication

lcc
  This will generate the ldif to either add or remove the main containers
or ou's, for your directory. You have the option of adding a sudoers ou
as well
-i	insert
-r	remove
-d	domain name
-s	sudo

lcc [ -i | -r ] -d <domain-name> (-s)

lsc
  This will generate an ssl configuration to add to the already existing
configuration for the domain. You must have already have the certificate
and key pair for the domain, and optionally the CA certificate. The key
should be in /etc/ldap/ssl.key, the certificate in /etc/ldap/ssl.crt and
the CA cert (if you wish to add it) in /etc/ssl/certs. The CA certificate
file postfix should be .pem, as should the domain key file. The domain
certificate file should be postfixed with .crt. The domain key and certificate
should have their name as the domain name.

-i	insert
-r	remove
-a	CA certificate
-d	domain

lsc [ -i | -r ] -d <domain-name> (-a CA-file-name)
