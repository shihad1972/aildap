It would be usefule to have a function, similar to get_ldif_format, but here
a linked list is passed in with this structure:

typedef struct ailsa_ldif_s {
	char *type, *string;
	ailsa_ldif_s *next;
}

based on the number of members, we could then create an ldap string like so:

type(1)=string(1),type(2)=string(2).....type(x)=string(x)

This can be used to create the DN of an entry.
