It could be useful to have a function get_ldif_entry which would an input
linked list of structs like so:

typedef struct ailsa_ldif_entry_s {
        char *type, *values, *delim;
        ailsa_ldif_entry_s *next;
}

The delim value is what separates the entries in values, so for each struct
in the list, we would get a list of values separated by delim, and output:

type: value(1)
type: value(2)
....
type: value(x)

We would continue this for each struct in the list, to get the lidif entry
final output.
